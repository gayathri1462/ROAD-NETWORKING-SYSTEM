# ROAD-NETWORKING-SYSTEM
In this project we used Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path among the 10 cities Which can be implemented among any number of cities in the real world.We used folium package to display the map for better understanding of the path from source to destination.We also used Tkinter GUI for user interface and to create a better interaction between the user and our application.
